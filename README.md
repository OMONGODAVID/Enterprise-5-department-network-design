# Enterprise 5-Department Network Design

## Overview
This project simulates an enterprise-style campus network with 5 departments built in Cisco Packet Tracer.
The network supports five departments with wired and wireless connectivity, centralized DHCP,
VoIP phones, and network printers.

## Network Features
- 5 departments with dedicated subnets
- Central router providing DHCP to all devices
- Wired PCs per department
- Wireless access via Access Points
- VoIP phones per department
- Network printers
- Full inter-department communication

## IP Addressing Scheme
| Department | Subnet | Gateway |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Dept 1 | 192.168.10.0/24 | 192.168.10.1 |
| Dept 2 | 192.168.20.0/24 | 192.168.20.1 |
| Dept 3 | 192.168.30.0/24 | 192.168.30.1 |
| Dept 4 | 192.168.40.0/24 | 192.168.40.1 |
| Dept 5 | 192.168.50.0/24 | 192.168.50.1 |

## Technologies Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- DHCP
- IPv4 Subnetting
- Wireless Networking
- VoIP (IP Phones)
- LAN Switching & Routing

## How to Use
1. Download the `.pkt` file from the `packet-tracer/` folder
2. Open using Cisco Packet Tracer (v8+)
3. Power on devices and verify DHCP assignment
4. Test connectivity using ping and VoIP calls
