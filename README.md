# Enterprise 5-Department Network Design

## Overview
This repository contains the design and implementation of an enterprise-style
campus network built using Cisco Packet Tracer.

The network supports five departments with wired and wireless connectivity,
centralized DHCP, VoIP phones, and network printers.

## Key Features
- Five departmental subnets
- Centralized DHCP on router
- Wired and wireless client support
- VoIP and printer integration
- Inter-department communication

## Technologies Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- IPv4 Subnetting
- DHCP
- LAN Switching & Routing
- Wireless Networking
- VoIP (IP Telephony)

## How to Run
1. Download the Packet Tracer file from `packet-tracer/`
2. Open in Cisco Packet Tracer (v8+)
3. Power on all devices
4. Verify DHCP IP allocation
5. Test connectivity and VoIP calls

## Repository Structure
- `packet-tracer/` → Simulation files
- `documentation/` → Design and addressing details
- `configs/` → Configuration summaries
- `diagrams/` → Network topology images
